Data format:
	Last HOUR  in json [ dict ]
	Last 5MIN   in json [ dict ]
        daily in csv only the first column and separate by <;> 

Progress Steps:
	1. Design two methods for this project:
			i. using aws services only
			ii. using EC2 and hard code everything

	2. Find a way to store the sensor data    =<<<<<!!!!!!
		for all three formats.

	3. Program the setup script for the solution. 
		Boto3 

	4. develop front-end (the same for all methods)
		HTML and CSS 

	5. Test the solution and elasticity of the solutions.   <=== find the way of doing it from internet.
		Workload balance
		Scalability
		Cost

	 6. write Readme

Must have:
	1. A mechanism for auto update the database
	2. AQI convert.
	3. Be able to get/download the data according geographical location and timeframe
	4. Time the development time as well for different solutions. =<<!!!!
	5. Measure the current system workload to determine whether a new worker is required. --- a mechanism for introducing new workers. (system load is measured directly from the amount data being downloaded or the number of currently connected clients, or some other criteria.)
	6. Consider the cost implications of instantiating new workers and explain the reasoning of your design in the report from a cost perspective.

Success:
	1. handle multiple access: 
	2. cost per check
	3. speed test for each access

Additional task:
	1. experimental methodology test solution.
	2. why choose this architecture.
	3. computational requirements, costs or other factors drove you choice of aws services and how you measured success.
	4. provide a script to configures the AWS env
	5. Briefly discuss the implications of data security and sovereignty with respect to the environmental sensor.

Things to decide:
	Storage method or database 
	Where to host the website page
	load balance scheme
	how to measure metrics for data usage
	come up with solution policy matches the AWS framework pillars

important data:
	all raw sensors daily csvs ~ 428.61MB
	all raw sensors houly json  ~ 9.81MB
	all PM snesors monthly zip ~ 328.42 GB from 2015-10 to 2025-11
