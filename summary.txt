DATA :
	Last hour in json [ dict ]
	Last 5min in json [ dict ]
        daily in csv only the fist column separate by <;> 

What to do:
	Online Data:
	1. How to access these data ? store it to S3? or get it on demand?
	2. A mechanism for ensuring the data is kept up to date. every 5 min? everyday?
	3. AQI converter?

	Client side:
	4. be able to get/download the data according geographical location and timeframe
	5. workload investigation
	6. demon elasticity of my solution.
	7. consider the cost of the solution

	Additional task:
	1. experimental methodology test solution.
	2. why choose this architecture.
	3. computational requiremnets, costs or other factoes drove you choice of aws services and how you measured success.
	4. provide a script to configures the AWS env
	5. Briefly discuss the implications of data security and sovereignty with respect to the environmental sensor.
