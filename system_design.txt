Problem so far:
    1. Find a way to host website:
        EC2 vs S3 vs AWS Elastic beanstalk(Full stack) !!
        cloudfront is not there

    2. Find a way to store data:
        S3 vs Amazon DynanoDB vs Amazon RDS vs timestream
        S3: https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/?nc=sn&loc=4
        DynanoDB: https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/
        RDS: https://aws.amazon.com/rds/pricing/

    3. design load balance strategy:
        Elastic load balancing vs EC2 autoscaling

    4. url forwarding?
